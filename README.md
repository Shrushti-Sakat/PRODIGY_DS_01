# Prodigy InfoTech – Data Science Internship  
## Task 1: Population Data Visualization

### 📌 Objective
The objective of this task is to visualize the distribution of a categorical or
continuous variable using a bar chart or histogram.  
In this task, a **bar chart** is used to visualize the **population distribution
across the top 10 most populous countries in 2022**.

---

### 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** World Bank Population Data  
- **File:** `API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2_38144.csv`
- The dataset contains population data for countries across multiple years.
- Aggregated regions and income groups were removed to ensure that only
  **real country-level data** was used.

---

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab
- GitHub

---

### 📈 Visualization
- **Type:** Bar Chart
- **Categorical Variable:** Country
- **Continuous Variable:** Population
- **Year Analyzed:** 2022
- The bar chart clearly compares the population sizes of the top 10 most
  populous countries.
